## Introduction

Seismic events, such as earthquakes, play a crucial role in understanding the Earth's dynamics and are essential for assessing potential risks. Monitoring and analyzing seismic data are paramount tasks for seismologists and researchers. The fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with seismic data analysis has opened up exciting possibilities to deepen our understanding of seismic events.

## Key Points

- 📊 Explored seismic data parameters: latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude, time, and date.
- ⏰ Implemented time series analysis techniques.
- 📈 Utilized various algorithms for earthquake magnitude forecasting.
- 🗺️ Explored clustering techniques.
- 🚨 Applied anomaly detection methods.
- 🧪 Employed generative AI for synthetic seismic data generation.

## Problem Statement

Earthquakes, a natural force of immense power, often strike with little warning, leaving communities vulnerable to their devastating impact. "QuakeAI Fusion" is driven by a fundamental goal: to predict and understand these seismic events, ultimately contributing to early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

## Dataset

To achieve my objectives, I analyze a range of data parameters, including:

- **Latitude and Longitude**: Geographic coordinates specifying the location of seismic events.
- **Depth**: The depth at which an earthquake occurs beneath the Earth's surface.
- **Magnitude (mag)**: A measure of the energy released during an earthquake.
- **ID (Identifier)**: A unique code assigned to each seismic event.
- **Hour and Date**: The timing of seismic events.

These parameters are vital for comprehending earthquake patterns, trends, and potential impacts.  
The dataset, [Earthquake.csv]([dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WqG0S2r1GM_Rcyg2vQmFJ5pypc4EksGB/view)), is included in this repository for your convenience.
